<h2 id="Power-leaks" class = "h2col">7 Things That Leak Your Power</h2> 
  <ol style="color: rgb(139, 34, 69)">
    <li>
      <strong>Apologizing before speaking.</strong><br>
      <em>The power leak:</em> Starting sentences with "Sorry, but...".<br>
      <em>The hidden cost:</em> Training others to value your input less.<br>
      <em>How to fix it:</em> Start directly with your point - no disclaimers needed.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Over-explaining your decisions.</strong><br>
      <em>The power leak:</em> Giving lengthy justifications for every choice you make.<br>
      <em>The hidden cost:</em> People start seeing you as insecure and lacking authority.<br>
      <em>How to fix it:</em> State your decision clearly once, offer details only if asked.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Sharing self-doubts publicly.</strong><br>
      <em>The power leak:</em> Voicing uncertainties to seem humble or relatable.<br>
      <em>The hidden cost:</em> Others start doubting your capabilities too.<br>
      <em>How to fix it:</em> Save vulnerability for private conversations with trusted mentors.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>The permission pattern.</strong><br>
      <em>The power leak:</em> Asking for approval on things within your authority.<br>
      <em>The hidden cost:</em> Reducing your perceived decision-making power.<br>
      <em>How to fix it:</em> Inform about decisions made, don't ask when you can decide.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Waiting to be picked.</strong><br>
      <em>The power leak:</em> Hoping someone notices your work instead of highlighting it.<br>
      <em>The hidden cost:</em> Others take credit or get opportunities meant for you.<br>
      <em>How to fix it:</em> Share your wins in team meetings, update your boss regularly.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>The reactive schedule.</strong><br>
      <em>The power leak:</em> Letting others control your calendar and priorities.<br>
      <em>The hidden cost:</em> Your important work takes a backseat to others' urgencies.<br>
      <em>How to fix it:</em> Block time for your priorities before others fill your schedule.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>The instant response habit.</strong><br>
      <em>The power leak:</em> Replying to everything immediately, regardless of priority.<br>
      <em>The hidden cost:</em> People expect constant availability and quick answers.<br>
      <em>How to fix it:</em> Set response times based on message importance, not sender status.
    </li>

<h2 id='Sorry' class="h2col ">Why do we all say <em>SORRY</em> so much?</h2>
  <p>Overusing the word makes it meaningless.</p>
  <p>How many times have you said <strong>SORRY</strong> this week? For many of us, it‚Äôs more than we‚Äôd like to admit.</p>
  
  <h3>Over-apologizing can:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>‚Ü≥ Undermine your confidence</li>
    <li>‚Ü≥ Reduce your assertiveness</li>
    <li>‚Ü≥ Dilute the power of genuine apologies</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I noticed this was something I was doing regularly. And recently, I‚Äôve tried to focus on what I can say instead.</p>
  
  <h4>Instead of automatically reaching for sorry, consider these alternatives to express your message clearly and confidently:</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <span>‚ùå So sorry to bother you again</span> <br>
      <span class="correct">‚úÖ Is now a good time to discuss‚Ä¶?</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>‚ùå Sorry, that I‚Äôm late</span> <br>
      <span class="correct">‚úÖ Thanks for your patience.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>‚ùå Sorry, I don‚Äôt know anything about that</span> <br>
      <span class="correct">‚úÖ Let me look into this and get back to you.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>‚ùå Sorry, I can‚Äôt make that time</span> <br>
      <span class="correct">‚úÖ I‚Äôm unavailable then; could we find another slot?</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>‚ùå Sorry, I need help with this again</span> <br>
      <span class="correct">‚úÖ I‚Äôd appreciate your guidance on this.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>‚ùå Sorry, for talking too much</span> <br>
      <span class="correct">‚úÖ Thank you for listening to me.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>‚ùå Sorry, I need to cancel our plans</span> <br>
      <span class="correct">‚úÖ Something‚Äôs come up; can we pick another day?</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>‚ùå Sorry, I don‚Äôt have time right now</span> <br>
      <span class="correct">‚úÖ I‚Äôm tied up at the moment; let‚Äôs set a time to talk.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>‚ùå Sorry, that‚Äôs not my responsibility</span> <br>
      <span class="correct">‚úÖ Let me direct you to the right person for that.</span>
    </li>
